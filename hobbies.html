    <p>One of the main hobbies I love is music. All my life I've grown to love music. I come from a very musical background. My family is pretty talented when it comes to music, whether it's singing, playing instruments, or even composing music.Growing up, my family, cousins, uncles, aunties, etc... they always encouraged me to persue something in music. Although that isn't really my pathway in life, I still love music.</p>

    <p> I just recently started getting back into playing sports. One of my favourite sports to playis netball. I like being able to be on a court with my friends and play against other schools. I like playing netball because after everything with school and studies, netball is a way for me to just forget about all my assessments, even if it's only for 40mins, its a way for me to get away from the books and pens and just have fun.</p>
