      <p>My name is Silivia Teulilo. This website will give you a little more insight of who I am, my hobbies, interests, culture, etc... If there is anything you are still unsure of my details will also be provided.</p>
        <p> A little background information about me is that, I am a professional hustler. Me and my co-worker hustle money all day, everyday! If we ask you for money just know our slogan is "We'll pay you back tomorrow" so if we haven't paid you within that second I'm sorry we were hungry.</p>

      <p>I was born in Tonga but raised in New Zealand. All my life I was bought up in West Auckland and also went to schools around that area. I currently go to Auckland Seventh-day Adventist Highschool in South Auckland, which was really out of my comfort zone at first. I've been attending ASDAH for 2 years now and I'm currently a year 11 ongoing NCEA Level 1. I hate talking to people,I am not a people person, and I'm not one to speak if not spoken to. I come from a family of 7. I have two brothers and two sisters. I'm a very lazy person, but I still try to be active. I am cureently 15 years of age, and I wish we could go back into lockdown. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, but because of these restrictions I wish we could go back to level 4.</p>
